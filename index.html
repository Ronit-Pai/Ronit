            <h2><i class="fas fa-user fa-sm"></i> About Me</h2>
            <p class="about_text">Hello my name is Ronit, I am a passionate and dedicated  Computer Science Engineering student with good foundation in Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning , Web Development. 
        Currently pursuing my B.Tech. at NMAMIT, I consistently strive for academic excellence and hands-on learning.
        <br>
        I enjoy solving real-world problems using technology and have worked on few projects involving  web development, Python automation, machine learning. 
        With strong communication and collaboration skills, I aim to contribute meaningfully to innovative tech solutions and grow continuously as a developer.
        <br>
I recently worked on a machine learning project focused on predicting lung cancer using clinical data, where I applied classification algorithms to identify high-risk cases with promising accuracy. 
This project has evolved into a research initiative, and I am currently authoring a conference paper to publish our findings in a peer-reviewed journal.
